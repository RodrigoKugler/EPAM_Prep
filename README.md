## 🎯 The 3 Problems EPAM WILL Ask

### 1. SQL: Cumulative Orders ⭐⭐⭐
**Calculate running total of orders per customer**

Where: `01_SQL/02_Window_Functions.md`  
Time limit: 10 minutes  
Uses: ROW_NUMBER(), SUM() OVER()

### 2. Python: Word Counting ⭐⭐⭐
**Count words from input (case-insensitive)**

Where: `02_Python/01_String_Manipulation.md`  
Time limit: 10 minutes  
Uses: Counter, .lower(), .split()

### 3. Python: Email Domains ⭐⭐⭐
**Extract unique domains from JSON**

Where: `02_Python/02_JSON_Processing.md`  
Time limit: 12 minutes  
Uses: json.load(), set comprehension

**Master these 3 = You're 80% ready!**

2. **Attempt** exercises (60-90 min)
3. **Check** solutions only after trying
4. **Retry** any you got wrong
5. **Update** PROGRESS_TRACKER.md

### Time Yourself
- SQL problems: < 10 minutes each
- Python problems: < 15 minutes each
