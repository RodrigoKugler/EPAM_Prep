## üìã Systematic Approach

### Phase 1: Content Audit & Planning
For each folder (01_SQL through 08_Interview_Prep):

1. **Analyze Current State**
   - What content exists?
   - What's missing?
   - What needs improvement?

2. **Define Learning Objectives**
   - What should students know after completing this module?
   - What skills should they be able to demonstrate?
   - How does this connect to EPAM interview success?

3. **Structure the Module**
   - Theory section with clear explanations
   - Multiple examples (beginner ‚Üí intermediate ‚Üí advanced)
   - Hands-on exercises
   - Real-world applications
   - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### Phase 2: Content Creation Standards

#### üìö Theory Sections Must Include:
- **Clear Learning Objectives** at the start
- **Why This Matters** - connection to EPAM/real work

- **Step-by-step explanations** (no assumptions about prior knowledge)
- **Visual examples** (tables, diagrams, code snippets)
- **Common patterns** and when to use them
- **Best practices** and gotchas
- **Quick reference** summary

#### üí° Examples Must Include:
- **3+ examples per concept** (simple ‚Üí complex)
- **Before/after** comparisons
- **Step-by-step walkthroughs**
- **Multiple approaches** to solve same problem
- **Real EPAM-style scenarios**
- **Edge cases** and how to handle them
- **Performance considerations**

#### üèãÔ∏è Exercises Must Include:
- **Progressive difficulty** (easy ‚Üí medium ‚Üí hard)
- **Clear problem statements** with expected output
- **Hints** (but not solutions)
- **Time estimates** for each exercise
- **Connection to interview scenarios**
- **Bonus challenges** for advanced learners
