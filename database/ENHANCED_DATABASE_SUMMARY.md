## üöÄ **Next Steps for Students**

### **1. Practice Window Functions**
```sql
-- Running total by customer
SELECT customer_id, order_date, total_amount,
       SUM(total_amount) OVER (
           PARTITION BY customer_id 
           ORDER BY order_date 
           ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) as running_total
FROM orders 
ORDER BY customer_id, order_date;
```

### **2. Test Complex Joins**
```sql
-- Top products by category with customer demographics
SELECT c.category_name, p.product_name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as unique_customers,
       SUM(oi.total_price) as total_revenue
FROM products p
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN customers cust ON o.customer_id = cust.customer_id
WHERE cust.customer_segment = 'Premium'
GROUP BY c.category_name, p.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### **3. Analyze Performance**
```sql
-- Employee salary progression with window functions
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.department_id,
       s.salary_amount, s.effective_date,
       LAG(s.salary_amount) OVER (
           PARTITION BY e.employee_id 
           ORDER BY s.effective_date
       ) as previous_salary,
       s.salary_amount - LAG(s.salary_amount) OVER (
           PARTITION BY e.employee_id 
           ORDER BY s.effective_date
       ) as salary_increase
FROM employees e
JOIN salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
ORDER BY e.employee_id, s.effective_date;
```
