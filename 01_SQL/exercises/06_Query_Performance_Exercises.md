**Task**: Analyze the execution plan for the following query and identify performance issues.

```sql
-- Given query
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.order_amount) as total_spent
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_segment = 'Premium'
GROUP BY c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

**Expected Output**: 
- Execution plan analysis
- Performance bottlenecks identified
- Optimization recommendations

**Hint**: Use `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` to analyze the execution plan

---

### Problem 1.2: Compare Execution Plans

**Task**: Compare execution plans for two different query approaches and recommend the better one.

**Query 1**:
```sql
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) as total_amount
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY o.order_id, o.order_date
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;
```

**Query 2**:
```sql
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.total_amount
FROM orders o
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY o.total_amount DESC;
```

**Expected Output**: 
- Execution plan comparison

## ðŸ”¥ Exercise 2: Index Design and Optimization

### Problem 2.1: Design Indexes for Query Optimization
**Tables**: `customers`, `orders`, `order_items`, `products`

**Task**: Design the optimal indexes for the following query patterns.

**Query Patterns**:
1. Find orders by customer
2. Find orders by date range
3. Find orders by customer and date
4. Find orders by amount range
5. Find orders by customer, date, and amount

**Expected Output**:

- Index creation statements
- Performance impact analysis

**Hint**: Consider single-column, composite, and covering indexes

---

### Problem 2.2: Index Usage Analysis
**Tables**: `orders` (1M records), `customers` (100K records)

**Task**: Analyze which indexes are being used and which are not.

**Given Indexes**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_order_date ON orders(order_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_amount ON orders(order_amount);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders(customer_id, order_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_segment ON customers(customer_segment);
```

**Queries to Analyze**:
```sql
-- Query 1
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;

-- Query 2
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- Query 3
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123 AND order_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- Query 4
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_amount > 1000;

-- Query 5
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_amount > 1000;
```

**Expected Output**:
- Index usage analysis for each query

    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id) as order_count,
    (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(order_amount), 0) FROM orders WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id) as total_spent
FROM customers c;
```

**Approach 3 - Window Function**:
```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) OVER (PARTITION BY c.customer_id) as order_count,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.order_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY c.customer_id), 0) as total_spent
